<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like dogs, movies, guitars, pianos, singing, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>

<p>I am a student in school</p>

<p>I want to be in computer science when I grow up. I want to be able to make cool things with a bunch of programming languages. Right now I still have lots to learn, but I am a fast learner and great student!</p>
